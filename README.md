# Network-Pen-Test-Malware-Analysis

The aim of this penetration test and the accompanying report was to identify potential weaknesses & vulnerabilities within the network infrastructure of “Company X”. To provide justification of highlighting these vulnerabilities, in this report, related exploits have been executed to show the severity of the found vulnerabilities. The process of penetration testing allows for a comprehensive report to be generated on both Company X’s network architecture and its organisational context as well. Company X had previously found and identified malware on their system before putting the infected files in a sandboxed system. Therefore, an additional part of this report is to analyse the malware both statically and dynamically in the sandboxed environment to identify the contained malware and how the malware operates.

To carry out the penetration test and malware analysis, specific tools were required. A combination of a Windows 10 and a Kali Linux workstation was used to carry out the technical elements of this report. Industry standard ‘Nmap’ was used to scan open TCP & UDP ports, whilst tools such as enum4linux & nbtenum were used for enumeration to find out about Company X’s network architecture, employee lists & contained policies. A Nessus vulnerability scan was performed to assess the severity of vulnerabilities and provide more context to the information obtained in the scanning & enumeration phases. System & password hacking was carried through exploiting a Rojetto exploit on a HTTP file server. XfreeRDP was used to gain remote access to the server as a domain admin because of this exploit. Another exploit was used in the form of a Reverse PHP shell to assist in manipulating file filtering on the company’s server. Static malware analysis was carried out using Virus Total & strings, whilst ‘App Any Run’ allowed for the dynamic analysis to take place alongside executing the malware in the sandbox environment.
